```

## Next Steps (Manual Action Required)

## Project Structure on V3 Branch
The v3 branch contains the complete PhishGuard project:
- Chrome Extension files (manifest.json, background.js, popup.html/js, content.js)
- Python backend (phishing_detection.py)

All components are version-aligned to 3.0.
